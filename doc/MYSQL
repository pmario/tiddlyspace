TiddlySpace uses MySQL as its storage. Therefore it requires:

* tiddlywebplugins.mysql3
* tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy3
* pyparsing
* sqlalchemy
* MySQL-Python

Also required, of course, is a version of MySQL itself. If your operating
system includes its own packaging of mysql, then use that. Otherwise see
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/ or consider MariaDB. As of April 2013
the main tiddlyspace.com server is using MariaDB.

Note that a version of mysql 5.5 or beyond is required for full unicode
support.

All of the Python modules are available from PyPI. Please read the
README and docs associated with tiddlywebplugins.mysql3 before attempting
to set up MySQL for TiddlySpace. This description may also be useful:

TiddlySpace uses InnoDB for all tables.

You will need to create two databases:

* 'tiddlyspace' for the dev instance
* 'tiddlyspacetest' for testing

You will need to grant a user access. Learning how to use msyql is
out of scope for this document. See http://www.mysql.com/ for
documentation, tutorials, etc.

TiddlySpace has a default store configuration of:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.tiddlyspace.store', {
        'db_config': 'mysql:///tiddlyspace?charset=utf8mb4'}],

which defaults to using whoever the current user is.

On the deployed server this is changed to:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.caching', {}],
    'cached_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.tiddlyspace.store', {
        'db_config': 'mysql://tiddlyweb@localhost/tiddlyspace?charset=utf8mb4'}],

which uses 'tiddlyweb' as the user.
