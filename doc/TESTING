Sauce Labs Testing
==================

Requires:

* Node
* A Sauce Labs account under TiddlySpace

The QUnit tests can be run against multiple browser types via the Sauce Labs
platform.

This requires a Sauce Labs username and access key.  Once you have these, set
them as environment variables as follows:

    export SAUCE_USERNAME=<username>
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<key>

Note: 

The Grunt file uses these variables when running the test task.
By default the username is "tiddlyspace".

For automated builds via Travis CI, the encrypted key from the .travis.yml
file is used.


For first time setup run:

    make saucelabs_deps

To run tests via Sauce Labs:

    make saucelabs_test

Testing Locally
===============

To run the QUnit tests on a local browser of your choice:

    make jstest_browser

Then navigate to:

    http://localhost:9999/test/
